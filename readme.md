Take the basis from 02_task:
- use redux! store, action, reducers
- make note in input, add to the list below. (last item on the list)
- use styling to overwrite/strikeout when clicked. (meaning DONE) start with delete as in the counter, modify after that to strikeout
- can also be strikeout = done, delete button = remove from list 
- css optional (task will be used later on sas)
- notes to db.json use json server and axios for posting
-
